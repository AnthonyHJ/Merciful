# Merciful Client
 The Merciful Client for former Skotos games

Merciful is a very unofficial Chrome client for the former Skotos-Tech games which aims to bring the functionality you love from Zealotry into the Chrome browser. These games include Castle Marrach, Multiverse Revelations and Allegory of Empires.

## Instructions for End Users

There are two ways to install Merciful

### Install from Chrome Web Store

If you are using a Chromium browser (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, etc.) then you can simply install from the Chrome Web Store. This is the easiest way and is recommended for anyone who just wants to play games without any tinkering.

### Run as an Unpacked Extension

If you want the latest changes as they happen and you are sure that you know what you are doing, you can run Merciful as an unpacked extension. There are two options for how to get the code.

* Download the source code as a .zip file:
  * Go to https://github.com/AnthonyHJ/Merciful
  * Click on 'Code' above source code
  * Download Zip
  * Unzip to your chosen folder
* Clone with your client of choice
  * Save to your chosen folder

Once you have the files: 
* Open the extensions manager in your browser
* Click on 'Load unpacked'
* Select the folder you just created
  * This folder should be the root folder containing Changelog.html
  * Do not open the images, sound, or themes folders
* Restart your browser

### Updating

If you are running an unpacked extension, either fetch from Github in your Git client or download the latest zip and overwrite the current files.
